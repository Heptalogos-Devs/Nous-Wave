# Official Client operations

Node consumers connect with `connectNousInstance({ runRoot })` from `@nous-wave/client/node`. The [Client package](../../packages/client/README.md) and canonical [public protocol](../../proto/README.md) define the typed methods. These operations use the same Core and semantic owners as CLI/MCP.

Persist the operation ID and exact request before mutations. Same ID/same normalized input replays the original result; changed input conflicts. Read the current object epoch/head before a new revision or lifecycle change, then freeze that expected value for retries. A model proposal is not an Authority mutation until its owner commits it.

## Required vocabulary

| Field | Accepted values and meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `subjects.adoptSeed.kind` | `initial` for initial adoption; `import` for an imported version. Omitted/empty means import. |
| `CognitiveSeed.format` | `application/vnd.nous-wave.cognitive-seed+toml;version=1`; text is nonempty TOML with `schema_version = 1`. Seed provenance belongs to the versioned source. |
| `MemoryContent.cognitiveRole` | `experiential`, `declarative`, `procedural_experience`. |
| `MemoryContent.formationMode` | `grounded` or `synthesized`; grounded requires its actual grounding Occurrence, synthesized requires independent supported inputs. |
| `MemoryContent.semanticRole` | A nonempty caller/producer semantic label, such as `working_practice` or `reported_fact`; it is not a closed enum. |
| `MemoryContent.epistemicClass` | Required: `observed`, `reported`, `derived`, `inferred`, `narrative`, `simulated`. This is the claim's epistemic category, not its cognitive role or formation mode. |
| `memory.revise.intent` | `correct`, `rephrase`, `reinterpret`; preserve the same cognition object's referent/scope continuity. |
| `memory.setAccessibility.mode` | `auto`, `normal`, `deep`, `explicit`; accessibility does not authorize suppression/purge bypass. |
| `identity.rebindEntity.bindingState` | `bound`, `unbound`, `disputed`. Bound requires `entityRef`; unbound forbids one. Mention ID belongs to an actual source Occurrence. |
| `model.formFromObservation.aboutnessMode` | `explicit`, `select_from_resolved_mentions`, `none`. Explicit aboutness refs require explicit mode. CLI `--aboutness` chooses explicit unless the caller specifies mode. |
| `Episode.revise.intent` | `resegment`, `reinterpret`; members and sources remain exact references. |
| `CognitiveSchemaContent.formationKind` | `explicit_import`, `synthesized`. Explicit import needs actual evidence; synthesized needs at least two independent known source roots. |
| Schema evidence role | `support`, `counterexample`, `boundary_case`; formation basis role separately uses `direct`, `interpretation`, `contextual`. |

## Source-backed correction and lifecycle

Use `memory.get({ subjectId, id: memoryId })` for current head/epoch and `memory.revision({ subjectId, id: revisionId })` for exact immutable content. `memory.revise` takes `memoryId`, `expectedObjectEpoch`, `operationId`, `intent`, and a complete `MemoryContent` including the actual basis, aboutness, tags and epistemic category. `memory.history` uses `memoryId` and bounded `page`. [NousQL](../agent/NOUSQL.md) provides current/as-of/history reads; current permission and purge fences always apply.

`memory.suppress/restore/withdraw/reaccept/purge` take the same mutation identity fields: `subjectId`, `memoryId`, `expectedObjectEpoch`, `operationId`. Re-read epoch for a new operation; replay uses the old frozen expected epoch. Suppression and withdrawal differ from purge; purge is irreversible. Lifecycle transitions do not create a content revision. Episode and Journal families have their corresponding typed lifecycle methods. WorkContext exact anchors are not silently rewritten when Memory head changes.

`concepts.createSchema/reviseSchema/splitSchema/mergeSchemas/addSchemaEvidence` use the public Schema contracts, exact evidence and object epoch. A schema is a supported transferable pattern with explicit applicability and boundary, not an arbitrary list of remembered facts. `subjects.seed/adoptSeed` read/adopt versioned sources; adoption does not silently replace already committed cognition.

`concepts.suppressSchema/restoreSchema/withdrawSchema/reacceptSchema/purgeSchema` take `subjectId`, `schemaId`, `expectedObjectEpoch`, and `operationId`. They use the Memory owner's lifecycle and dependency fences, without creating a content revision. Purge clears Schema revision content and resident/context/Association references, and revokes incoming Schema evidence links. Provenance and receipt identities may remain; previously recorded UseEvents replay as duplicates through content-free purge receipts. It does not delete shared admitted Material.

Mutation replay preserves the original operation and exact immutable revision. Returned mutable lifecycle state and object epoch describe the object's current state; a delayed suppress replay after restore does not suppress it again. Authorized `memory.get/revision` and Schema management reads expose content with current lifecycle fields for inspection and repair, including withdrawn/suppressed objects. Ordinary NousQL enforces visibility, including exact query targets; management reads do not recover purged content.

## Session, identities and consumers

Session state is isolated; WorkContexts belong to Subject and can continue across Sessions. Pause/end clears affected Session foreground bindings atomically; resume does not foreground a Session. Ended contexts cannot mutate/resume. `cognition.openSession/getSession/listSessions/closeSession` and WorkContext methods use this Runtime owner contract.

`identity.bind/resolve` discover real canonical identities and returned LexicalRefs. Same display names may produce ambiguity; use the chosen returned candidate, never guess a vector identity. `identity.rebindEntity` changes the interpretation of a source mention without rewriting its original surface.

`cognition.project/managedContext` require a `consumerId` with an operator-configured policy. A valid Subject or Session does not grant access to an unknown consumer. `config` can list/get/describe/set current policy/configuration within its advertised scope; model and resource profile changes require Core restart. Managed-context cursor reuse must preserve consumer identity, policy, source revisions and lifecycle.

## Maintenance and model execution

`cognition.grantMaintenance({ subjectId, maxOperations, maxModelCalls, maxElapsedMs })` gives a bounded opportunity. Subject effective `maintenance.enabled=false` disables it. Response disposition distinguishes disabled policy, no eligible work, processed work and exhausted opportunity. A second opportunity resumes durable needs/proposals; a grant is not a batch with an invented replay receipt. Actual model calls include route fallback.

Model-backed calls have a longer Client default deadline; explicit `timeoutMs` and cancellation take precedence. READY describes executable configured prerequisites, not successful provider calls or prepared Serving. `system.projections({ subjectId })` reports serving state; `model.prepareEmbeddings` builds bounded material using the configured provider batch size. Real query diagnostics and degradation decide whether a requested lane participated.
